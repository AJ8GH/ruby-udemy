# not all methods are public # phone.initialize # e.g.
phone = Gadget.new('user', 'passsword')
p phone.production_number

# issue is this method is public and we can call it outside the method.
p phone.generate_production_number #Â now this runs an error since adding private KW

# to solve :: we can make the method private. this means it can't be called on an object
# to make private we add private kw above the method. anything below is private.
# however other methods e.g. initialize will still have a access to it.
